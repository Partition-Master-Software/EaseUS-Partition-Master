## ‚ú® Main Functionalities

The utility provides a wide array of features aimed at giving users full control over their disk space and partition configuration. Key operations include non-destructive resizing of partitions to reallocate free space, merging adjacent partitions to create larger volumes, and splitting large partitions into smaller, more manageable units. For users upgrading their hardware, the disk copy and OS migration features are particularly beneficial, allowing for a seamless transition to new drives without reinstalling the operating system or applications. Data safety is a paramount concern, and the software incorporates mechanisms to protect user data during all operations, including power failure recovery support in its professional edition.

Furthermore, EaseUS Partition Master includes tools for checking disk health, testing surface sectors for errors, and wiping partitions securely to prevent data recovery. It can also create bootable media, enabling users to manage partitions and troubleshoot systems that fail to boot into Windows. This makes it not just a tool for everyday management but also a vital component of a comprehensive PC maintenance and recovery toolkit. Its support for virtual disk management and command-line execution (in professional versions) offers additional flexibility for advanced deployment scenarios in enterprise environments.
